Blue J IDE was used in order to estimate the mass of the Higgs boson produced in proton-proton collisions in LHC accelerator. Raw data for the 4 muons created in the decay chain was provided in a .csv file which was imported in Java.  Obtained estimate of the Higgs mass was confirmed to be around 300 GeV/c2, number being more than twice the actual value due to the fact that simulation was made a while ago. Some experimental study was also carried out to confirm various theoretical assumptions about the behaviour of the mass distribution of the products of the proton-proton collisions at √s = 14 TeV.
